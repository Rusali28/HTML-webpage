# HTML-webpage

Welcome to my first HTML Webpage!

The index.html file is the main file for the webpage. 

The file includes all implementations of HTML basics, following is a list of all implemented concepts.
The webpage has a visual illustration of the concepts. 

### Following is the list of concepts implemented:
+ Head and Body Tag
+ Headings, Paragraphs and Text
+ Heading structure
+ Default Browser styles (types of headers, styles of text)
+ Img tag
+ Links
+ Lists
+ HR and BR tags
+ div Tag
+ ID
+ Classes


## Extra implementations - Additionaly, I have added few more implementations:
### 1. Adding CSS to HTML - This can be done in 3 ways:
+ Inline Styling (using style attribute)
+ Internal Styling - by including the <style> tag in the head of the HTML file
+ External Styling - by creating a separate stylesheet and linking it to the HTML file using the <link> attribute in the head of the document
+ Adding Javascript to HTML
